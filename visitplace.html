                    <h3>Kathmandu</h3>
                    <p>Kathmandu is the capital city of Nepal. You can explore thousands of years of culture here, while making your way through historic temples and monasteries that belong to Hindus and Buddhists alike
Historically, the Kathmandu Valley and adjoining areas were known as Nepal Mandala. Until the 15th century, Bhaktapur was its capital when two other capitals, Kathmandu and Lalitpur, were established. During the Rana and Shah eras, British historians called the valley itself "Nepal Proper". Today, Kathmandu is not only the capital of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, but also the headquarters of the Central Development Region of Nepal. The Central Region comprises three zones: Bagmati, Narayani, and Janakpur. Kathmandu is located in the Bagmati Zone.

                    <h3>Pokhara</h3>
                    <p>Pokhara once lay on the important trade route between India and Tibet. To this day, mule trains set up camps on the city outskirts, bringing goods from remote Himalayan regions including Mustang. Gurungs and Magars, who have earned world-wide fame as fierce Gurkha warriors, are predominant here. Thakalis, indigenous of the Thak Khola region of Mustang, are known for their entrepreneurship and run tea houses along the trek routes in the Annapurna region. The Pokhara is best known for the stunning view of the Annapurna range. It is perhaps one of the few places on earth from where mountains above 6,000 m can be seen unobstructed from an altitude of 800 m within the distance of 28 km. </p>

                    <h3>Mustang</h3>
                    <p>The word “Mustang” is a Tibetan word, which means “Plain of Aspiration.” Mustang is one of the most remote areas of Nepal and is very isolated from the outer world. While Mustang is a remote region, it is visited by thousands of tourist yearly. Visitors ignore the remote location of this place and pay a visit to witness the traditional Tibetan culture and the beautiful views all around.

Mustang is bordered by Tibetan plateau, and the tallest mountains like Annapurna and Dhaulagiri, including several other peaks above 7,000 meters are also situated here. The elevation of Mustang rises from 1,372 to 8,167 meters.</p>

                    <h3>Tilicho</h3>
                    <p>Tilicho Lake is located at an altitude of 4919m in the Manang district. This is one of the world’s highest lakes situated at the highest altitude. This Lake is formed by the glacial melt of the northern slope of Annapurna Mountain and Thorung peak.
